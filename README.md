[![@atharane's Holopin board](https://holopin.io/api/user/board?user=atharane)](https://holopin.io/@atharane)

As a MERN stack developer with proficiency in cloud computing and DevOps, I have a strong foundation in web development. In addition to participating in hackathons, I also actively seek out opportunities to attend various developer events. My passion for programming extends beyond web development, as I have also gained experience in competitive programming. Beyond my technical skills, I have a strong interest in design.
